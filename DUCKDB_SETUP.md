# DuckDB Integration Options

## Option 1: Server-Only DuckDB (Recommended)

```typescript
// next.config.ts
const nextConfig: NextConfig = {
  experimental: {
    serverComponentsExternalPackages: ['duckdb'],
  },
  webpack: (config, { isServer }) => {
    if (!isServer) {
      // Completely exclude DuckDB from client bundle
      config.externals = config.externals || [];
      config.externals.push({
        'duckdb': false,
      });
      
      config.resolve.fallback = {
        ...config.resolve.fallback,
        'duckdb': false,
      };
    }
    return config;
  },
};
```

## Option 2: DuckDB WASM (Already Installed)

We actually have `@duckdb/duckdb-wasm` installed! This could work for client-side:

```typescript
// For client-side DuckDB
import * as duckdb from '@duckdb/duckdb-wasm';

// For server-side DuckDB  
import Database from 'duckdb'; // Only in API routes
```

## Option 3: Hybrid Approach

- Server: Native DuckDB for heavy analytics
- Client: DuckDB WASM for local queries
- Sync between them

## Why SQLite Was Chosen Instead

1. **Simpler Integration**: better-sqlite3 has better Next.js support
2. **Smaller Bundle**: Less dependencies and native code
3. **Proven Compatibility**: Widely used in Next.js projects
4. **Faster Setup**: Got working immediately

## DuckDB Advantages We're Missing

1. **Columnar Storage**: Better for analytics queries
2. **Advanced Analytics**: Built-in statistics functions
3. **Parquet Support**: Could read/write analytics files
4. **Better Performance**: For large aggregations
5. **SQL Features**: More advanced SQL capabilities
